/*!
 * Class for computing and compensating for overlapping (outer) wall lines.
 * The overlapping area is approximated with connected trapzoids.
 * All places where the wall is closer than the nozzle width to another piece of wall are recorded.
 * The area of a trapezoid is then the length between two such locations multiplied by the average overlap at the two locations.
 * 
 * The amount of overlap between two locations is recorded in a link, so that we can look up the overlap at a given point in the polygon.
 * A link always occurs between a point already on a polygon and either another point of a polygon or a point on a line segment of a polygon.
 * In the latter case we insert the point into the polygon so that we can later look up by how much to reduce the extrusion at the corresponding line segment.
 * This is the reason that the polygons are converted to linked lists before the wall overlap compensation computation takes place, after which they are converted back.
 * 
 * At the end of a sequence of trapezoids the overlap area generally ends with a residual triangle.
 * Therefore points are introduced on the line segments involved and a link is created with overlap zero.
 * 
 * We end up with a mapping from each link to a boolean value representing whether the trapezoid is already compensated for.
 * Each point on the polygons then maps to a link (and its corresponding boolean), so that we can easily look up which links corresponds 
 * to the current line segment being produced when producing gcode.
 * 
 * When producing gcode, the first line crossing the overlap area is laid down normally and the second line is reduced by the overlap amount.
 * 
 * The main functionality of this class is performed by the constructor.
 * The adjustment during gcode generation is made with the help of WallOverlapComputation::getFlow
